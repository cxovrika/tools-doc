# enum4linux

### Packages
* [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/enum4linux/)

### Usage
```
/usr/bin/enum4linux version [unknown] calling Getopt::Std::getopts (version 1.12 [paranoid]),
running under Perl version 5.32.1.

Usage: enum4linux [-OPTIONS [-MORE_OPTIONS]] [--] [PROGRAM_ARG1 ...]

The following single-character options are accepted:
	With arguments: -u -p -f -R -s -k -w -K
	Boolean (without arguments): -U -M -N -S -P -G -l -L -D -d -r -v -o -h -n -a -i -P

Options may be merged together.  -- stops processing of options.
Space is not required between options and their arguments.
  [Now continuing due to backward compatibility and excessive paranoia.
   See 'perldoc Getopt::Std' about $Getopt::Std::STANDARD_HELP_VERSION.]
enum4linux v0.8.9 (http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/application/enum4linux/)
Copyright (C) 2011 Mark Lowe (mrl@portcullis-security.com)

Simple wrapper around the tools in the samba package to provide similar 
functionality to enum.exe (formerly from www.bindview.com).  Some additional 
features such as RID cycling have also been added for convenience.

Usage: /usr/bin/enum4linux [options] ip

Options are (like "enum"):
    -U        get userlist
    -M        get machine list*
    -S        get sharelist
    -P        get password policy information
    -G        get group and member list
    -d        be detailed, applies to -U and -S
    -u user   specify username to use (default "")  
    -p pass   specify password to use (default "")   

The following options from enum.exe aren't implemented: -L, -N, -D, -f

Additional options:
    -a        Do all simple enumeration (-U -S -G -P -r -o -n -i).
              This opion is enabled if you don't provide any other options.
    -h        Display this help message and exit
    -r        enumerate users via RID cycling
    -R range  RID ranges to enumerate (default: 500-550,1000-1050, implies -r)
    -K n      Keep searching RIDs until n consective RIDs don't correspond to
              a username.  Impies RID range ends at 999999. Useful 
	      against DCs.
    -l        Get some (limited) info via LDAP 389/TCP (for DCs only)
    -s file   brute force guessing for share names
    -k user   User(s) that exists on remote system (default: administrator,guest,krbtgt,domain admins,root,bin,none)
              Used to get sid with "lookupsid known_username"
    	      Use commas to try several users: "-k admin,user1,user2"
    -o        Get OS information
    -i        Get printer information
    -w wrkg   Specify workgroup manually (usually found automatically)
    -n        Do an nmblookup (similar to nbtstat)
    -v        Verbose.  Shows full commands being run (net, rpcclient, etc.)

RID cycling should extract a list of users from Windows (or Samba) hosts 
which have RestrictAnonymous set to 1 (Windows NT and 2000), or "Network 
access: Allow anonymous SID/Name translation" enabled (XP, 2003).

NB: Samba servers often seem to have RIDs in the range 3000-3050.

Dependancy info: You will need to have the samba package installed as this 
script is basically just a wrapper around rpcclient, net, nmblookup and 
smbclient.  Polenum from http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/application/polenum/ 
is required to get Password Policy info.

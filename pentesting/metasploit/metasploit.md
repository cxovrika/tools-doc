# Metasploit

### Packages
* Available directly as [Manjaro package](https://discover.manjaro.org/packages/metasploit)


### Initializing the Database (needed only once, after intallation)
```
msfdb init
```

**Notes**:
* Might need to manually install `postgresql` package for `initdb` and `pg_ctl` binaries
* Might fail at `Attempting to start MSF web service` part, haven't investigated yet (CLI should still work if db initialization went well)


## Impressions
Just completed [this](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpmetasploit) room. Covered only basic usage.

Metasploit seems like a powerful framework, with some fancy shmancy functionality that gathers the tools that I was using before in once place. For example it has built in nmap, no need to run it separately and recording results.

Overall The room gave only brief overview (I had no idea what the exploits were *actually* doing) and probably Metasploit takes reasonable amount of time to learn (and have understand what's actually happneing behind the scene). Just like any other popular framework for front/back development does (if not more :O)

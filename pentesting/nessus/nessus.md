# Nessus

## Description
Nessus uses techniques similar to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, which are then, presented in a nice GUI for us to look at.

Nessus is different from other scanners as it doesn't make assumptions when scanning, like assuming the web application is running on port 80 for instance.

### Packages
* Available as [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nessus)

## Thoughts
Similar to Metasploit. Same thoughts. Completed this [room](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnessusredux). Very brief info, but covers installation and basic usage. Seems like av ery powerful tool that does everything for you in 3-4 clicks, if you know what you're doin.

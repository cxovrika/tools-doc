* [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) - tends to be very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest
* [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search) - keeps track of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) -- whether or not there is an exploit publicly available
* [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/)


Notes:
* ExploitDB has a useful CLI tool called `searchsploit` that uses local copy of the database
